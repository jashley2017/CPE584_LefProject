                * LOOP until "END CELL"
                * Store error for each missing property
            * LOOP until EOF
            * Look for rare property_definitions (workaround for not supporting properties?)
    * Sort the properties recorded by MACRO name, then internal property name
    * If liberty file is to be read, collect all files under provided directory
        * Find all lines that declare a cell
        * Find all lines that declare a pin
        * Assume that all pins belong to the preceding cell (by line count)

            * Verify that the SIZE in LEF agrees with the AREA in LIBs
        * Verify that every pin declared in the LEF was found in the LIBs
    * Step through all the error handling

        * Found unrecognized cell properties
        * Found unrecognized layer name

        * Cells missing from LEF that are in LIB
        * Pins missing from LEF that are in LIB
        * Cells missing from LIB that are in LEF
        * Pins missing from LIB that are in LEF
